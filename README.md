## Introduction & Background
- Explain the problem & why it's important to solve.
- We want to create something scientific & data-driven.
- Explain the background of the problem with supporting data.
- Explain the benefits of your research results.

## Sampling Design
- Describe it according to the stages described on the previous page.
- Create illustrations to taste.
- Create math equations neatly. For example, using Latex.
- Also explain the reasons why you chose the design.

## Analysis
- Describe the results of your sampling design.
- Does the result make sense?
- What is the effectiveness of your sampling design? For example from the side:
 -Cost
 -Time
 - Resources needed
- Explain the weaknesses/problems/limitations that should be known from your sampling design and how to overcome them.

## Conclusion
- Show the conclusions of the sampling design & the results you made.
- again
    - Sampling design results
